**Epic Owner:** Juan Antonio Bre√±a Moral
**Priority:** Medium
**Target Release:** ASAP
**Estimated Scope:** Medium - 1-3 months

---

## Business Value & Strategic Goals

Facilitate the generation of the diagram in PNG format automatically because Github doesn't render in Markdown .plantuml files.

### Target Users
Developers

### Success Criteria
Generate a .png with the same filename given in the .puml and generate the image in the same path of the .puml.

---

## Problem Statement

Generate .png files on demand using a CLI tool passing as input the path of a .puml

---

## Solution Overview

Develop a CLI which pass a .puml and the tool then generate with the same filename a .png

---

## Key Features & Components

- **PlantUML File Processing**: Convert from .puml to .png format
- **Command Line Interface**: Accept .puml file path as input parameter
- **File Output Management**: Generate PNG with same filename in same directory as source
- **PlantUML Integration**: HTTP-based integration with PlantUML server for rendering
- **Network Connectivity**: Leverages HTTP requests to PlantUML server for diagram generation
