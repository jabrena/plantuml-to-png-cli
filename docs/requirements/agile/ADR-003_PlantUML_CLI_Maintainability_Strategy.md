# ADR-003: PlantUML to PNG CLI Tool - Maintainability Strategy

**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Status:** Proposed
**Primary NFR Category:** Maintainability

## Context

The PlantUML to PNG CLI tool is a focused, single-purpose application that converts .puml files to .png format for GitHub documentation workflows. As a simple developer tool with limited scope, it requires a maintainability strategy that balances code quality with development efficiency while preventing unnecessary complexity.

### Forces and Constraints

- **Limited Scope:** Single-purpose CLI tool with well-defined conversion functionality
- **Development Context:** Single developer, no team expansion planned
- **Simplicity Requirement:** Tool should remain easy to understand and modify
- **Quality Standards:** Must meet established quality gates (JaCoCo coverage, compiler checks)
- **External Dependencies:** Graphviz dependency and PlantUML library integration
- **Technology Stack:** Java 24, Maven, PicoCLI framework already established

### Quality Attributes and Requirements

**Primary Focus: Maintainability**
- **Modularity:** Clean separation between CLI interface and business logic
- **Analysability:** Code should be immediately understandable without extensive documentation
- **Modifiability:** Easy to fix bugs and make small enhancements
- **Testability:** Adequate test coverage achievable with minimal complexity

**Supporting Quality Characteristics:**
- **Performance Efficiency:** Adequate for single-file conversion use case
- **Reliability:** Handled through comprehensive testing strategy (ADR-002)

## Decision

We have decided to implement **"Keep It Simple" Maintainability Strategy** with minimal architecture and targeted quality tooling.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Option 1: Multi-Layer Architecture with Separate Modules
- **Pros:** Clear separation of concerns, potential for reusability, follows enterprise patterns
- **Cons:** Over-engineering for simple CLI tool, increased complexity, unnecessary abstraction layers
- **NFR Impact:** Would improve modularity but harm analysability and modifiability due to complexity
- **Implementation Cost:** High complexity for minimal benefit
- **Why Not Chosen:** Violates principle of proportional architecture - too much structure for a simple conversion tool

#### Option 2: Extensive Quality Tooling Suite
- **Pros:** Comprehensive code analysis, multiple quality metrics, enterprise-grade tooling
- **Cons:** Tool overhead, configuration complexity, diminishing returns for simple codebase
- **NFR Impact:** Marginal maintainability improvement with significant setup and maintenance cost
- **Implementation Cost:** High initial setup and ongoing maintenance overhead
- **Why Not Chosen:** Existing JaCoCo and compiler plugins provide sufficient quality gates for this scope

#### Option 3: Design Pattern Implementation
- **Pros:** Follows established patterns, potentially more extensible
- **Cons:** Adds abstraction layers, increases cognitive load, unnecessary for current requirements
- **NFR Impact:** Reduces analysability and modifiability through added complexity
- **Implementation Cost:** Medium complexity with no clear benefit
- **Why Not Chosen:** Design patterns should solve actual problems, not be applied preemptively

### Rationale

The "Keep It Simple" approach directly addresses the maintainability requirements while respecting the limited scope and single-developer context. This decision prioritizes:

1. **Cognitive Simplicity:** Two-class architecture (CLI + Service) provides clear separation without unnecessary abstraction
2. **Development Velocity:** Minimal structure enables faster development cycles and easier bug fixes
3. **Quality Assurance:** Existing tooling (JaCoCo, compiler plugins) provides adequate quality gates
4. **Proportional Architecture:** Architecture complexity matches problem complexity

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts
- **Faster Development Cycles:** Minimal architecture reduces development overhead and enables rapid iteration
- **Easy Bug Fixes:** Simple structure makes issue diagnosis and resolution straightforward
- **Minimal Cognitive Overhead:** New developers (if needed) can understand the entire codebase quickly
- **Quality Standards Compliance:** Existing tooling ensures code quality without additional complexity
- **Maintenance Efficiency:** Less code to maintain, fewer dependencies to manage
- **Clear Boundaries:** Well-defined scope prevents feature creep and over-engineering

### Negative Impacts and Mitigation
- **Limited Extensibility:** Simple structure may not accommodate major feature additions → **Mitigation:** Review trigger defined for significant scope expansion
- **Potential Refactoring Need:** Future growth might require architectural changes → **Mitigation:** Accept technical debt for current scope, plan refactoring if tool grows significantly
- **Reduced Reusability:** Components not designed for reuse → **Mitigation:** Acceptable trade-off given no reuse requirements identified

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Scope Creep Risk:** Simple architecture might encourage adding features without proper design → **Mitigation:** Maintain clear scope definition, review architecture if audience grows significantly
- **Quality Degradation:** Minimal tooling might miss quality issues → **Mitigation:** Existing JaCoCo and compiler plugins provide sufficient coverage; comprehensive acceptance testing (ADR-002) catches functional issues
- **Knowledge Transfer Risk:** Simple design might lack documentation → **Mitigation:** Code simplicity serves as self-documentation; existing ADRs provide architectural context

## Implementation

### Approach
1. **Maintain Two-Class Architecture:** CLI class (PicoCLI interface) + Service class (conversion logic)
2. **Leverage Existing Quality Tools:** Continue using JaCoCo coverage analysis and compiler plugins
3. **Focus on Code Clarity:** Prioritize readable, self-documenting code over complex abstractions
4. **Minimal Dependencies:** Keep dependency footprint small and focused

### Affected Systems and Teams
- **Development:** Single developer maintains simplified development workflow
- **Build System:** Maven configuration remains minimal with existing quality plugins
- **Testing Strategy:** Aligns with comprehensive acceptance testing approach (ADR-002)

### Success Metrics
- **Development Velocity:** Time from requirement to implementation remains minimal
- **Bug Resolution Time:** Issues can be diagnosed and fixed within single development session
- **Code Comprehension:** New developer can understand entire codebase within 30 minutes
- **Quality Gate Compliance:** Maintains 80% JaCoCo coverage and passes all compiler checks
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Less than 10% of development time spent on maintenance tasks

## Compliance and Governance

### Review and Approval
- **Reviewers:** Development team (single developer)
- **Approval Required From:** Project owner

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality:** JaCoCo coverage minimum 80%, Error Prone and NullAway compliance
- **Architecture Standards:** Two-class maximum, clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation Standards:** Self-documenting code, ADR documentation for decisions

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Review Triggers
- **Scope Expansion:** If tool requirements grow beyond single-file conversion
- **Audience Growth:** If tool gains significant user base requiring enterprise features
- **Team Expansion:** If development team grows beyond single developer
- **Quality Issues:** If current tooling proves insufficient for maintaining quality

### Evolution Strategy
- **Gradual Enhancement:** Maintain simplicity while adding focused features
- **Architecture Review:** Reassess structure if complexity increases significantly
- **Quality Tool Evaluation:** Consider additional tooling only if clear quality gaps emerge
