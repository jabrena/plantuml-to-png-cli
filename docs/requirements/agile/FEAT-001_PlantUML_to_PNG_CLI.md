# Feature: PlantUML to PNG CLI Tool

**Epic:** [EPIC-001_PlantUML_to_PNG_CLI.md](./EPIC-001_PlantUML_to_PNG_CLI.md)
**Priority:** Medium
**Owner:** Juan Antonio BreÃ±a Moral
**Status:** Planning

---

## Overview

A command-line interface tool that converts PlantUML (.puml) files to PNG format, automatically generating PNG images with the same filename in the same directory as the source file.

### Business Value
Enables developers to automatically generate PNG diagrams from PlantUML files for use in GitHub Markdown documentation, eliminating the manual conversion process and ensuring diagrams are always up-to-date.

### Target Users
Developers working with PlantUML diagrams in GitHub repositories and Markdown documentation.

---

## Feature Description

This feature provides a complete CLI tool that accepts PlantUML file paths as input and generates corresponding PNG images. The tool integrates PlantUML processing, file management, and command-line interface capabilities into a single, cohesive solution.

### Key Capabilities
- Command-line interface that accepts .puml file paths as arguments
- PlantUML file parsing and validation
- PNG image generation using HTTP requests to PlantUML server
- Automatic file naming (same as source .puml file)
- Output file placement in the same directory as source file
- Error handling and user feedback

### User Benefits
- Streamlined workflow for converting PlantUML diagrams to PNG format
- Consistent file naming and organization
- Integration-ready for CI/CD pipelines and build processes
- Eliminates manual conversion steps in documentation workflows

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Accept .puml file path as command-line argument
- Parse and validate PlantUML file syntax
- Convert .puml content to PNG format using HTTP integration with PlantUML server
- Generate PNG file with same base filename as source .puml file
- Save PNG file in the same directory as the source .puml file
- Provide clear success/error messages to the user
- Handle file system permissions appropriately

### Secondary Requirements
- Support batch processing of multiple .puml files
- Provide verbose output option for debugging
- Support different output formats (future extensibility)
- Configuration options for image quality/resolution

## User Stories

### Suggested User Story Breakdown
1. **As a developer, I want to convert a single PlantUML file to PNG format via command line, so that I can quickly generate diagrams for documentation.**

2. **As a developer, I want the generated PNG file to have the same name as my .puml file and be placed in the same directory, so that my file organization remains consistent.**

3. **As a developer, I want clear error messages when the conversion fails, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues with my PlantUML files.**

4. **As a developer, I want the CLI tool to validate my PlantUML syntax before conversion, so that I can catch syntax errors early in the process.**

5. **As a developer, I want to integrate this tool into my build process, so that PNG diagrams are automatically generated whenever PlantUML files are updated.**

## Acceptance Criteria

This feature will be considered complete when:
- [ ] CLI tool successfully accepts .puml file paths as arguments
- [ ] PNG files are generated with the same filename as source .puml files
- [ ] PNG files are created in the same directory as source files
- [ ] Tool provides appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- [ ] User testing validates the feature meets developer workflow needs
- [ ] Feature is documented and ready for deployment

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code is peer-reviewed and meets quality standards
- [ ] Unit and integration tests are written and passing
- [ ] CLI tool documentation is complete
- [ ] Error handling covers all identified edge cases
- [ ] Performance criteria are satisfied for typical file sizes

---

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Maven build system configuration
- Java application structure and packaging

### External Dependencies
- HTTP connectivity to PlantUML server (e.g., plantuml.com)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on target systems

### Feature-Specific Dependencies
- File system read/write permissions
- Valid PlantUML syntax in input files
- Sufficient disk space for PNG output files
- Internet connectivity for HTTP requests

---

## Technical Considerations

### Technical Notes
- CLI argument parsing and validation
- HTTP client integration for PlantUML server requests
- File I/O operations for reading .puml and writing .png files
- Error handling for file system operations
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations
- Network error handling and timeout management

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### General Risk Areas
- **Technical Complexity:** HTTP integration may have learning curve. Mitigation: Start with simple HTTP examples and build complexity gradually.
- **User Adoption:** Developers may prefer existing tools or manual processes. Mitigation: Focus on seamless integration with existing workflows and clear documentation.
- **Timeline Risk:** Dependency on external PlantUML server behavior. Mitigation: Thorough testing with various PlantUML file types and early prototype development.

### Specific Risk Considerations
- **Network Connectivity:** Internet connection may not be available or PlantUML server may be down. Mitigation: Implement proper error handling with retry logic and clear error messages about connectivity issues.
- **File Permissions:** Users may lack write permissions in source directories. Mitigation: Implement proper error handling and suggest alternative output locations.
- **PlantUML Compatibility:** Different PlantUML syntax versions may cause issues. Mitigation: Use stable PlantUML server endpoints and document supported syntax features.

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Successful conversion rate (target: >95% for valid PlantUML files with network connectivity)
- Average conversion time per file (target: <10 seconds for typical diagrams including network latency)
- User error rate (target: <10% due to clear error messages)

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- Developer adoption rate within the team
- Reduction in manual conversion time
- Integration success rate in CI/CD pipelines

---

## Timeline & Milestones

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 weeks (based on epic scope and feature complexity)

### Key Milestones
- [ ] Feature requirements finalized
- [ ] Technical design completed
- [ ] Development phase started
- [ ] First working version (MVP)
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Feature ready for release
